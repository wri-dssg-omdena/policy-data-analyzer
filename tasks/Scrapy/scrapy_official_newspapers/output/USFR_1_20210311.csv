A petitioner's timely submitted comment on the proposed amendments concerning the definition was, inadvertently, not made part of the record in the rulemaking docket and was, therefore, not available to be considered by the EPA when the agency finalized the definition of ``low pressure gas well'' in its December 19, 2014, final amendments to the NSPS. To correct the above mentioned procedural defect, the EPA is re-proposing its definition of ``low pressure gas well'' for notice and comment. The EPA is also soliciting comment on certain issues raised in the missed comment. We are also proposing to amend the NSPS to remove provisions concerning storage vessels connected or installed in parallel and to revise the definition of ``storage vessel''.

Such procedures must be consistent with the Secretary's statutory responsibility to ensure that there are no able, willing, qualified and available U.S. workers to perform these jobs, and that the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. Before the current rulemaking, variances from the general H- 2A regulatory requirements were established and revised for these occupations through sub-regulatory guidance, i.e. ``special procedures,'' that were issued in the form of separate Field Memoranda or Training and Employment Guidance Letters. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recently ruled that the existing special procedures for sheepherding, goat herding and open range production of livestock are not interpretive rules but rather include substantive departures from established regulatory requirements necessitating notice and comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act. This proposed rule provides the public with the notice and opportunity to comment on proposed procedures to be followed in the filing and processing of applications involving herding and production of livestock on the open range. Among the issues addressed are the qualifying criteria for employing foreign workers in the applicable job opportunities, preparing job orders, program obligations of employers, filing of H-2A applications requesting temporary labor certification, recruiting U.S. workers, determining the minimum offered wage rate, and the minimum standards for mobile housing on the open range. The Department's goal is to establish a single set of regulations enabling employers seeking to hire foreign temporary agricultural workers for both herding and production of livestock on the open range to comply with their obligations under the H-2A program given the unique characteristics of these job opportunities in their industry.",Temporary Agricultural Employment of H-2A Foreign Workers in the Herding or Production of Livestock on the Open Range in the United States,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2015-04-15/granules/2015-08505/summary?api_key=

Our review of the status of this subspecies shows that the threats to the subspecies have been eliminated or reduced, and adequate regulatory mechanisms exist. The subspecies is now viable over the next 100 years with sufficient protected habitat to support breeding and movement of individuals between subpopulations so that the subspecies is not currently, and is not likely to again become, a threatened species within the foreseeable future in all or a significant portion of its range. We also propose to remove from the List the American black bear, which is listed within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear due to similarity of appearance.

This rule is proposed according to the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The proposed would include a prohibition on directed non-tribal Pacific sardine commercial fishing for Pacific sardine off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, which is required because the estimated 2015 biomass of Pacific sardine has dropped below the cutoff threshold in the HG control rule. Under the proposed action Pacific sardine may still be harvested as part of either the live bait or tribal fishery or incidental to other fisheries; the incidental harvest of Pacific sardine would initially be limited to 40-percent by weight of all fish per trip when caught with other CPS or up to 2 metric tons (mt) when caught with non-CPS.

The following twelve (12) OPDs (dated October 1, 2014) have been revised to reflect coast line data of the Gulf Coast of Florida that was originally approved by the U.S. Baseline Committee in 1999. Specifically, the coast line, Submerged Lands Act boundary, and the OCS Lands Act ``Section 8(g) Zone'' boundary have been revised. Eight (8) SOBDs (dated October 1, 2014) located within OPD NH16-05 (Pensacola) have been revised to reflect the intersection of the Submerged Lands Act and Section 8(g) Zone boundaries for the States of Florida and Alabama (known as the ``Florida wrap-around''). Two (2) SOBDs (dated October 1, 2014) also located within OPD NH16-05 (Pensacola) have been revised to reflect the intersection of the Submerged Lands Act and Section 8(g) Zone boundaries with the ``Military Mission Line.'' BOEM is also publishing a total of six hundred ninety-two (692) SOBDs that were generated by the Minerals Management Service (a predecessor bureau of BOEM) using coast line data that was originally approved by the U.S. Baseline Committee in 1999. These SOBDs (dated March 1, 1999) reflect the Submerged Lands Act and the Section 8(g) Zone boundaries adjacent to the Gulf Coast of Florida. In 2000, the SOBDs were submitted to the State of Florida for signature, indicating their concurrence with the MMS depiction of the boundaries. Although Florida did not sign the SOBDs, the diagrams reflect the current Federal position of these boundaries, and will eventually be superseded by diagrams with an updated format and BOEM logo. BOEM will continue working with Florida to resolve any areas of boundary discrepancy.",Outer Continental Shelf Official Protraction Diagrams and Supplemental Official Outer Continental Shelf Block Diagrams,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2015-05-18/granules/2015-11993/summary?api_key=

Specific areas for designation include sixteen occupied areas within the range of the species: ten areas in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) and six in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). These areas contain one or a combination of habitat types: Preferred pupping and nursing areas, significant haul-out areas, and/or marine foraging areas, that will support conservation for the species. Specific areas in the NWHI include all beach areas, sand spits and islets, including all beach crest vegetation to its deepest extent inland, lagoon waters, inner reef waters, and including marine habitat through the water's edge, including the seafloor and all subsurface waters and marine habitat within 10 meters (m) of the seafloor, out to the 200-m depth contour line around the following 10 areas: Kure Atoll, Midway Islands, Pearl and Hermes Reef, Lisianski Island, Laysan Island, Maro Reef, Gardner Pinnacles, French Frigate Shoals, Necker Island, and Nihoa Island. Specific areas in the MHI include marine habitat from the 200-m depth contour line, including the seafloor and all subsurface waters and marine habitat within 10 m of the seafloor, through the water's edge 5 m into the terrestrial environment from the shoreline between identified boundary points on the islands of: Kaula, Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Maui Nui (including Kahoolawe, Lanai, Maui, and Molokai), and Hawaii. In areas where critical habitat does not extend inland, the designation ends at a line that marks mean lower low water. Some terrestrial areas in existence prior to the effective date of the rule within the specific areas lack the essential features of Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat because these areas are inaccessible to seals for hauling out (such as cliffs) or lack the natural areas necessary to support monk seal conservation (such as hardened harbors, shorelines or buildings) and therefore do not meet the definition of critical habitat and are not included in the designation. In developing this final rule we considered public and peer review comments, as well as economic impacts and impacts to national security. We have excluded four areas because the national security benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion, and exclusion will not result in extinction of the species. Additionally several areas are precluded from designation under section 4(a)(3) of the ESA because they are managed under Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans that we have found provide a benefit to Hawaiian monk seals.",Endangered and Threatened Species: Final Rulemaking To Revise Critical Habitat for Hawaiian Monk Seals,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2015-08-21/granules/2015-20617/summary?api_key=

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council and NMFS recently discovered that the use of Chinook salmon PSC by the Non-Rockfish Program CV Sector in the first few months of 2015 was exorbitantly greater than the historical use, which was relied on in developing the Chinook salmon PSC limit for this sector, and that this discrepancy in use was not foreseen when the PSC limit of 2,700 Chinook salmon for the Non- Rockfish Program CV Sector was implemented under Amendment 97.

Today, India's cities account for approximately 60% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By 2030, that share is expected to reach 75% and the urban labor force is expected to increase by nearly 200 million workers. The new Indian Government led by Prime Minister Modi assumed office in June 2014 with an overwhelming mandate to focus on economic development. To capture the popular imagination and motivate the people of India, the new government has proposed a dramatic nationwide program to build 100 smart cities. In practice this will mean a wide variety of major infrastructure projects across the country that will be funded by the central and state governments over the next few years along with private sector capital. Infrastructure needs in India are estimated to be in the $1.5-$2 trillion range. The recently launched initiative will move to define and implement reforms that drive the growth of smart cities. At this stage, the government has highlighted resource management, 24 hour water and power supply, world class transportation systems, state of the art education systems, advanced e-government, and environmental sustainability as pillars of India's smart cities. This initiative offers excellent opportunities for U.S. companies to participate in these projects in selected areas and sectors. In recognition of cutting-edge U.S. technologies, products and services, the Government of India is encouraging the U.S. Government (USG) and U.S. companies to take the lead in developing smart city projects in three major urban areas: Ajmer in the state of Rajasthan, Allahabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Vishakhapatnam (aka Vizag) in the state of Andhra Pradesh. With the support of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, U.S. companies will be involved in planning and technical assistance for each of these cities. However, U.S. participation is not limited to these three cities.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is including requirements for methane emissions in this proposal because methane is a greenhouse gas (GHG), and the oil and natural gas category is currently one of the country's largest emitters of methane. In 2009, the EPA found that by causing or contributing to climate change, GHGs endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations. The EPA is proposing both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not currently covered by the NSPS and proposing methane standards for certain emission sources that are currently regulated for VOC. The proposed amendents also extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment across the source category and additionally establish methane standards for this equipment. Lastly, amendments to improve implementation of the current NSPS are being proposed which result from reconsideration of certain issues raised in petitions for reconsideration that were received by the Administrator on the August 16, 2012, final NSPS for the oil and natural gas sector and related amendments. Except for the implementation improvements and the setting of standards for methane, these amendments do not change the requirements for operations already covered by the current standards.",Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New and Modified Sources,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2015-09-18/granules/2015-21023/summary?api_key=

The primary uses of FMRs are to determine payment standards for the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, to determine initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts, to determine initial rents for housing assistance payment contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program, and to serve as rent ceilings for rental assistance units in the HOME Investment Partnerships program. FMRs are used in the calculation of maximum award amounts for Continuum of Care grantees and are also used in the calculation of flat rents in Public Housing units. Today's notice provides proposed FY 2016 FMRs for all areas that reflect the estimated 40th and 50th percentile rent levels trended to April 1, 2016. The FY 2016 FMRs are based on ``5-year'' data collected by the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2009 through 2013. These data are updated by one-year 2013 ACS data for areas where statistically valid one-year ACS data is available. HUD continues to use ACS data in different ways according to the statistical reliability of rent estimates. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rent and utility indexes are used to further update the data to 2014. These values are then trended forward to FY 2016 using the annualized change in median gross rents as measured across the most recent 5 years of available 1 year ACS data. While HUD will continue to use this trend factor for the calculation of FY 2016 FMRs, the Department is considering replacing it with a forward-looking forecast for the FY 2017 FMRs. For example, HUD is evaluating the use of a model that would forecast national rent and utility CPI indices based on economic assumptions used in the formulation of the President's Budget. HUD seeks public comments on this or alternative methodologies, as well as other data sources, for trending rent levels forward. The proposed FY 2016 FMRs in this notice incorporate a change in the level of statistical reliability that is allowed for an ACS estimate to be used in the calculation of FMRs. Previously, if the error of the estimate was less than the estimate itself, HUD used the estimate. The Proposed FMRs in this notice use ACS estimates where the size of the error is limited to half of the estimate. An additional change to the proposed FY 2016 FMRs is the incorporation of the February 28, 2013, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metropolitan area definition update based on the 2010 Decennial Census data. The 2013 ACS data are the first to use the new area definitions in the compilation of the ACS data. In a June 2, 2015 advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, HUD solicited comments on several topics related to the calculation of FMRs, including possible measures the Department is considering that would reduce the concentration of Section 8 voucher tenants. For example, HUD is evaluating alternatives to the current 50th percentile FMR program, which was implemented to mitigate excessive geographic concentration of voucher tenants. Comments were requested to determine interest in a program that is based on different measures for determining how many and which areas would receive special FMRs to encourage deconcentration, as well as on alternative FMR-based tools for promoting deconcentration, such as Small Area FMRs estimated at the ZIP code level.

NOAA accomplishes this, in part, through the use of observations obtained through a range of systems, including satellites, ships, ground, and in-situ networks. NOAA's space-based Earth observations are both important and challenging to obtain. In recent years, the commercial sector has invested increasing amounts of capital and resources to develop new technologies, and to build, launch, and operate satellites and ground- based systems. In order to respond to an ever-growing demand for environmental information, NOAA seeks to maintain an observing enterprise that is flexible, responsive to evolving technologies, and economically sustainable, while supporting and upholding NOAA's strong commitment to public safety and the international data sharing system upon which NOAA depends for global data. This policy establishes the broad principles for the use of commercial space-based approaches for NOAA's observational requirements, and opens a pathway for new industry to join the space- based Earth observation process. As a part of this effort, and to ensure we examine potential solutions, NOAA is seeking comments, suggestions, and innovative ideas from the public on Draft NOAA Commercial Space Policy.

The EPA is in the process of reviewing the Standards of Performance for MSW Landfills based on changes in the landfills industry since the standards were promulgated in 1996 and issued a proposed rulemaking on July 17, 2014. The EPA's review of the Standards of Performance for MSW Landfills (also referred to as the New Source Performance Standards or NSPS for MSW Landfills) applies to landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after July 17, 2014. This document proposes to achieve additional reductions of landfill gas (LFG) and its components, including methane, through a lower emission threshold at which MSW landfills must install and operate a gas collection and control system (GCCS). This document supplements the proposed July 17, 2014, rulemaking by further lowering, from 40 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) to 34 Mg/yr, the proposed NMOC emissions threshold at which controls would be required. This change to the 2014 proposed threshold is based on additional data we have reviewed that indicate greater potential for reductions in methane emissions from these sources than we originally estimated that can be achieved at reasonable cost. Accordingly, the EPA is proposing to establish the NMOC emission rate threshold for installing a GCCS at 34 Mg/yr and is requesting comment specifically on whether this is appropriate. The EPA is also soliciting comment on the number of facilities that might ultimately become subject to proposed new subpart XXX. The EPA intends to consider the information received in response to this supplemental proposal prior to finalizing revised Standards of Performance for MSW Landfills.

Gravel for construction would come from a new mine west of the Kadleroshilik River. A pipeline would link the LDPI to the Badami Sales Oil Pipeline (Badami pipeline). The pipe-in-pipe pipeline would be buried along a route going south from the LPDI to the shoreline west of the Kadleroshilik River, transition to an above-ground pipeline, and continue south to tie into the existing Badami pipeline. Oil produced from the LDPI would be transported through the Badami pipeline to the existing common carrier pipeline system to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. This NOI also serves to announce the beginning of the scoping process. The scope of an EIS refers to the range of issues, alternatives, and mitigation measures to be considered. Public scoping assists the agency in focusing on significant issues and alternatives and eliminating from detailed consideration those issues that are insignificant, irrelevant or have been fully and adequately considered in prior analyses.

Furthermore, based on our risk review, we are finalizing new and revised emission standards for certain HAP emissions from potlines using the Soderberg technology to address risk. We are also adding a requirement for electronic reporting of compliance data, eliminating the exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunctions (SSM), and not adopting the affirmative defense provisions proposed in 2011, consistent with a recent court decision vacating the affirmative defense provisions.

The overarching intent is to reduce the likelihood of a relatively small number of high-risk outliers exhausting their capital and causing systemic losses--which, by law, all federally insured credit unions would have to pay through the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).
