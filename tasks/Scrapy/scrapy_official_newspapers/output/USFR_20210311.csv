MLC modules are learning opportunities that are available at designated touchpoints throughout servicemembers' careers and that help servicemembers plan for transition well before separation. This CIR module will help make servicemembers and veterans aware of the community resources and services available; it will also help them learn to use Federal tools like the National Resource Directory to identify and vet those resources and services and decide how and when to engage them for assistance. Organizations interested in supporting servicemembers and veterans as they integrate into their communities are encouraged to register with the National Resource Directory (NRD) by visiting http:// nrd.gov and selecting ``Submit a Resource.'' Registration in NRD ensures that your organization is included in the MLC module's resources and makes your organization visible and accessible to servicemembers and veterans across the Nation.,Veterans Community Integration Resources Military Life Cycle Module,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2019-02-07/granules/2019-01495/summary?api_key=

NMFS has issued exempted fishing permits (EFPs) that allow each Gulf state (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida) to set the private recreational season for red snapper that are landed from state and Federal waters in that state during 2018 and 2019. For recreational harvest by the Federal for-hire component, the season closes at 12:01 a.m., local time, on August 2, 2019. These closures are necessary to prevent the private angling and Federal for-hire components from exceeding their respective quotas, equivalent to annual catch limits (ACLs), for the 2019 fishing year and to prevent overfishing of the Gulf red snapper resource.","Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico; 2019 Recreational Fishing Seasons for Red Snapper in the Gulf of Mexico",https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2019-03-12/granules/2019-04430/summary?api_key=

In its March 28, 2018 Order, the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia rejected challenges based on the calculations and methods for setting the fees and APHIS' adoption of the final rule. However, the Court also held that APHIS improperly relied on an expired provision in the relevant statute to justify its ability to levy a fee to support a reserve account. In so doing, the Court did ``not evaluate or rule on the agency's current argument that it has authority to fund a reserve'' pursuant to other statutory authority. In this clarification to the final rule, APHIS clarifies that, while we accept the court's holding that congressional authority under one specific provision of the statute to maintain a reasonable balance in the reserve account expired in 2002, this expiration does not abrogate our authority to collect for a reserve, as that authorization is written into other provisions of the statute. This interpretation is consistent with APHIS' long-standing precedent as set forth in prior rulemakings. The agency is only seeking comments related to the legal authority for the reserve component of AQI User Fee Program and is not reexamining any other aspect of the program at this time, including the AQI User Fee calculation.",User Fees for Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection Services,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2019-04-26/granules/2019-08394/summary?api_key=

This mandatory survey is conducted under the authority of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act. This Notice constitutes legal notification to all United States persons (defined below) who meet the reporting requirements set forth in this Notice that they must respond to, and comply with, this survey. Additional copies of the reporting forms SHL (2019) and instructions may be printed from the internet at: http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/ forms-sh.aspx Definition: A U.S. person is any individual, branch, partnership, associated group, association, estate, trust, corporation, or other organization (whether or not organized under the laws of any State), and any government (including a foreign government, the United States Government, a State or local government, and any agency, corporation, financial institution, or other entity or instrumentality thereof, including a government-sponsored agency), who resides in the United States or is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Who Must Report: The following U.S. persons must report on this survey: (1) U.S. persons who manage the safekeeping of U.S. securities (as specified below) for foreign persons. These U.S. persons, who include the affiliates in the United States of foreign entities, and are henceforth referred to as U.S. custodians, must report on this survey if the total market value of the U.S. securities whose safekeeping they manage on behalf of foreign persons--aggregated over all accounts and for all U.S. branches and affiliates of their firm--is $100 million or more as of June 30, 2019. (2) U.S. persons who issue securities, if the total market value of their securities owned directly by foreign persons--aggregated over all securities issued by all U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates of the firm, including investment companies, trusts, and other legal entities created by the firm--is $100 million or more as of June 30, 2019. U.S. issuers should report only foreign holdings of their securities which are directly held for foreign residents, i.e., where no U.S.-resident custodian or central securities depository is used. Securities held by U.S. nominees, such as bank or broker custody departments, should be considered to be U.S.-held securities as far as the issuer is concerned. (3) U.S. persons who receive a letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that requires the recipient of the letter to file Schedule 1, even if the recipient is under the exemption level of $100 million and need only report ``exempt'' on Schedule 1. What To Report: This report will collect information on foreign resident holdings of U.S. securities, including equities, short-term debt securities (including selected money market instruments), and long-term debt securities. How To Report: Copies of the survey forms and instructions, which contain complete information on reporting procedures and definitions, may be obtained at the website address given above in the Summary, or by contacting the survey staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at (212) 720-6300 or (646) 720-6300, email: SHLA.help@ny.frb.org.

The final rule also simplifies, for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, the calculation for the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties (sometimes referred to as a minority interest) that is includable in regulatory capital. In addition, the final rule makes technical amendments to, and clarifies certain aspects of, the agencies' capital rule for both non-advanced approaches banking organizations and advanced approaches banking organizations (technical amendments).

Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we plan to initiate a review of the status of Mojave poppy bee (Perdita meconis) to determine whether the petitioned action is warranted. To ensure that the status review is comprehensive, we are requesting scientific and commercial data and other information regarding that species. Based on the status review, we will issue a 12-month petition finding, which will address whether or not the petitioned action is warranted, in accordance with the Act. We find that the second petition to add a species to the list does not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. Therefore, we are not initiating a status review of Yellowstone National Park bison (population of Bison bison bison) in response to the petition. We refer to this finding as a ``not substantial'' petition finding. Lastly, we find that the third petition--a petition to revise the critical habitat designation for the currently listed Mount Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis)--presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.

BWC asserts that for that identified basic model, application of the calculation specified in the DOE test procedure to determine recovery efficiency yields an ``artificially high'' value that in turn results in a lower overall uniform energy factor value. Consequently, BWC seeks to use an alternate test procedure to address issues involved in testing the basic model identified in its petition. More specifically, BWC has requested that DOE waive the equation for calculating recovery efficiency of the consumer gas-fired storage water heater basic model for which the first occurrence of the main burner cutting out (``cut- out'') occurs during a draw. Instead, BWC requests that the recovery efficiency for this water heater be calculated using a revised recovery efficiency equation that accounts for the first cut-out occurring during a draw. For the reasons discussed in this document, DOE grants BWC an interim waiver from the DOE's consumer water heater test procedure for the basic model listed in the interim waiver, subject to use of the alternate test procedure as set forth in the Interim Waiver Order.

In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to amend certain airworthiness regulations for fire protection of interior compartments on transport category airplanes. The proposal would convert those flammability regulations from detailed, prescriptive requirements into simpler, performance-based standards. The proposal would divide these standards into two categories: those designed to protect the airplane and its occupants from the hazards of in-flight fires, and those designed to protect the airplane and its occupants from the hazards caused by post-crash fires. In addition, the proposal would remove test methods from the regulations and allow applicants, in certain cases, to demonstrate compliance either without conducting tests or by providing independent substantiation of the flammability characteristics of a proposed material. The proposal includes conforming changes to various FAA regulations. The proposal is necessary to eliminate unnecessary testing, increase standardization, and improve safety.

We are proposing to project the volume of gasoline and diesel that will be exempt in 2020 due to small refinery exemptions based on a three-year average of the relief recommended by the Department of Energy (DOE). From 2016-2018 the relief recommended by the DOE would have resulted in a reduction to the renewable volume obligation of approximately 770 million RINs per year. The amended definitions proposed in this rule would effectively increase the percentage standards that apply to non-exempt obligated parties to offset future small refinery exemptions and help ensure that the required volumes are met.","Renewable Fuel Standard Program: Standards for 2020 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2021, and Response to the Remand of the 2016 Standards; Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking",https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2019-10-28/granules/2019-23379/summary?api_key=

Specifically, EPA is now proposing adjustment factors to apply to both vehicle GHG and fuel economy test results for the GHG and CAFE programs and the Fuel Economy and Environment Label. In addition, we propose that the shift to required use of the new fuel for all vehicle testing be phased in through Model Year 2024, but required in Model Year 2025. Because the purpose of the rule is simply to realign testing results in response to the test fuel change, there would be no significant costs associated with the proposed action.",Vehicle Test Procedure Adjustments for Tier 3 Certification Test Fuel,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2020-05-13/granules/2020-07202/summary?api_key=

On June 26, 2019, the EPA published a proposed national primary drinking water regulation (NPDWR) for perchlorate and requested public comments on multiple alternative actions, including the alternative of withdrawing the 2011 regulatory determination for perchlorate.

The EPA has considered these public comments and based on the best available information the Agency is withdrawing the 2011 regulatory determination and is making a final determination not to regulate perchlorate. The EPA has determined that perchlorate does not occur ``with a frequency and at levels of public health concern'' within the meaning of the SDWA. In addition, in the judgment of the EPA Administrator, regulation of perchlorate does not present a ``meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems.''

The changes in this rule codify aspects of the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act of 2011 (RLDWA) and the Community Fire Safety Act of 2013 (CFSA). The RLDWA amended section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which prohibits the use and introduction into commerce of certain plumbing products that are not ``lead free.'' The RLDWA revised the definition of lead free to lower the allowable maximum lead content of plumbing products; and established a statutory method for calculating lead content. EPA is also establishing new requirements for manufacturers or importers that introduce into commerce products that must meet lead free requirements to certify such products as being in compliance with the lead free requirements in Section 1417 of the SDWA, as well as other changes to existing regulations to assist in implementation of Section 1417 of the SDWA, as amended. EPA expects that these requirements for lead content in plumbing materials used in new installations and repairs will result in fewer sources of lead in drinking water and, consequently, will reduce adverse health effects associated with exposure to lead in drinking water.

The final rule establishes a quantitative metric, the NSFR, to measure the stability of the funding profile of certain large banking organizations and requires these banking organizations to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR is designed to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization's regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, promote effective liquidity risk management, and support the ability of banking organizations to provide financial intermediation to businesses and households across a range of market conditions. The NSFR supports financial stability by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis, reducing the possibility that funding shocks would substantially increase distress at individual banking organizations. The final rule applies to certain large U.S. depository institution holding companies, depository institutions, and U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, each with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, together with certain depository institution subsidiaries (together, covered companies). Under the final rule, the NSFR requirement increases in stringency based on risk-based measures of the top-tier covered company. U.S. depository institution holding companies and U.S. intermediate holding companies subject to the final rule are required to publicly disclose their NSFR and certain components of their NSFR every second and fourth calendar quarter for each of the two immediately preceding calendar quarters.
