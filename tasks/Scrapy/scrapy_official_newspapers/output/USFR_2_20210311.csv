The Army Career Tracker (ACT) exists to enable Soldiers and Army civilians world-wide with career development and transition resources. ACT provides users with a more efficient and effective way to monitor their career development while allowing leaders to track and advise subordinates on personalized leadership development. As a leader development tool, it integrates data on training, education, and experiential learning from a number of source systems into one personalized and easy-to-use interface. ACT allows supervisors to track and advise employees on their leadership development and allows career program managers the ability to reach their geographically dispersed careerists. The Total Army Sponsorship Program is also administered through ACT. The sponsorship program provides Soldiers and Army civilians and their families with resources to facilitate their transition and/or relocation between commands and duty assignments. This alteration to the system of records notice incorporates the applicable DoD Routine Uses in the notice to provide clarity for the public. The categories of individuals has been updated to reflect the inclusion of Army Reserve, Guard, and Reserve Officer Training Corps personnel. The category of records was expanded to cover data that is collected and used in support of the Total Army Sponsorship Program. Further, the authorities were updated to cite the specific sections of the United States Code and identify the DoD issuances that implement the program. The purpose has been revised to clarify the use and description of these records. The systems that are data sources or interface with ACT have been denoted in the records source categories.

This withdrawal is based on a thorough review of the best scientific and commercial data available, which indicate that the headwater chub and the roundtail chub DPS are not discrete taxonomic entities and do not meet the definition of a species under the Act. These fish are now recognized as a part of a single taxonomic species--the roundtail chub (Gila robusta). Because the entities previously proposed for listing are no longer recognized as species, as defined by the Act, we have determined that they are not listable entities and we are withdrawing our proposed rule to add them to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. Section 4(b)(6) of the Act and implementing regulations at 50 CFR 424.17 provide that the Service must, within 1 year of a proposed rule to list, delist, or reclassify species, or to designate or revise critical habitat, withdraw the proposal if the available evidence does not justify the proposed action.

The measures establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (3-200 NM) off Washington, Oregon, and California. The management measures are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably among treaty Indian, non- treaty commercial, and recreational fisheries. The measures are also intended to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries in order to provide for spawning escapement and inside fisheries (fisheries occurring in state internal waters).",Fisheries Off West Coast States; West Coast Salmon Fisheries; 2017 Management Measures and a Temporary Rule,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2017-04-28/granules/2017-08638/summary?api_key=
